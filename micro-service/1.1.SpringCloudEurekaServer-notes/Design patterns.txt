In software design, there are **three main categories** of design patterns, and within them, there are **23 classical GoF (Gang of Four) patterns** ‚Äî plus many more patterns that evolved later.

---

## **1. Creational Patterns**

> These deal with **object creation mechanisms**, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

* **Singleton** ‚Üí Ensures only one instance exists.
* **Factory Method** ‚Üí Subclass decides which class to instantiate.
* **Abstract Factory** ‚Üí Creates families of related objects.
* **Builder** ‚Üí Constructs complex objects step-by-step.
* **Prototype** ‚Üí Creates objects by cloning.

üìå **Example**: `RestClient.builder()` in Spring Boot uses **Builder Pattern** to flexibly configure HTTP client options before creating the actual `RestClient`.

---

## **2. Structural Patterns**

> These deal with **object composition** ‚Äî how classes and objects can be combined to form larger structures.

* **Adapter** ‚Üí Converts one interface into another.
* **Bridge** ‚Üí Separates abstraction from implementation.
* **Composite** ‚Üí Treats individual and group of objects uniformly.
* **Decorator** ‚Üí Adds behavior dynamically without modifying class.
* **Facade** ‚Üí Simplifies complex subsystems with a single interface.
* **Flyweight** ‚Üí Reduces memory usage by sharing objects.
* **Proxy** ‚Üí Acts as a placeholder for another object.

üìå **Example**: `@LoadBalanced` in Spring Cloud is like a **Proxy Pattern**, intercepting calls and routing them to available instances.

---

## **3. Behavioral Patterns**

> These deal with **object interaction and responsibility**.

* **Chain of Responsibility** ‚Üí Pass requests along a chain of handlers.
* **Command** ‚Üí Encapsulates a request as an object.
* **Interpreter** ‚Üí Implements a specialized language.
* **Iterator** ‚Üí Sequentially access elements without exposing details.
* **Mediator** ‚Üí Reduces direct communication between objects.
* **Memento** ‚Üí Captures and restores object state.
* **Observer** ‚Üí Notifies objects automatically of state changes.
* **State** ‚Üí Allows object behavior to change with its state.
* **Strategy** ‚Üí Encapsulates interchangeable algorithms.
* **Template Method** ‚Üí Base class defines the skeleton of an algorithm.
* **Visitor** ‚Üí Adds new operations without modifying objects.

üìå **Example**: Spring Event Listeners use **Observer Pattern** to trigger events across beans.

## **Creational Patterns** (5) ‚Äì *Object creation mechanisms*

| # | Pattern              | Description                                                                  | Example in Java/Spring Boot                                                  |
| - | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | **Singleton**        | Ensures only **one instance** of a class exists.                             | Spring Beans by default are **Singleton scope** (`@Service`, `@Repository`). |
| 2 | **Factory Method**   | Subclass decides which object to create.                                     | `Calendar.getInstance()` in Java, or `TaskExecutorFactoryBean` in Spring.    |
| 3 | **Abstract Factory** | Creates **families of related objects** without specifying concrete classes. | `BeanFactory` / `ApplicationContext` in Spring.                              |
| 4 | **Builder**          | Constructs complex objects step-by-step.                                     | `RestClient.builder()` in Spring Web or `ResponseEntity.ok().body(...)`.     |
| 5 | **Prototype**        | Clones existing objects instead of creating new ones.                        | Spring‚Äôs `BeanFactory` with `prototype` scope beans.                         |

| 6  | **Adapter**   | Converts one interface to another.                       | `Spring MVC`‚Äôs `HandlerAdapter` for controller types.     |
| 7  | **Bridge**    | Separates abstraction from implementation.               | `JpaRepository` interface + Hibernate/JPA implementation. |
| 8  | **Composite** | Treats individual and composite objects uniformly.       | Spring Security `ConfigAttribute` list for roles.         |
| 9  | **Decorator** | Adds functionality without changing original class.      | `HttpServletRequestWrapper` in Spring filters.            |
| 10 | **Facade**    | Simplifies a complex subsystem with a unified interface. | `JdbcTemplate` simplifies JDBC operations.                |
| 11 | **Flyweight** | Shares objects to save memory.                           | Spring Bean caching in `ApplicationContext`.              |
| 12 | **Proxy**     | Acts as a placeholder controlling access.                | Spring AOP Proxies for `@Transactional`.                  |

| 17 | **Mediator**                | Central object manages communication.                    | Spring MVC `DispatcherServlet`.                       |
| 18 | **Memento**                 | Saves/restores object state.                             | `HttpSession` for saving user state.                  |
| 19 | **Observer**                | One-to-many dependency, auto notify on change.           | Spring Events (`ApplicationEventPublisher`).          |
