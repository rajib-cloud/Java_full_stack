# ðŸš€ Java + Spring Boot + Microservices Practice Repository

This repository is my personal **learning hub** for practicing and mastering:

* **Java (Core + Advanced)**
* **Spring Boot (3.x, Java 21)**
* **Microservices architecture**
* **Databases (MySQL/PostgreSQL)**

I use this space to store **practice projects, code snippets, and notes** as I build real-world applications and experiment with different concepts.
